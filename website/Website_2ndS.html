                <article><h2>What Is a Growth Mindset?</h2>
                    <p>There are enviable individuals who acquire skills and knowledge effortlessly, others are more orderly and achievement-focused than are their peers, and still others who exhibit unusual talents. 
                    While such positive traits are not evenly distributed, they are not necessarily out of reach for those who are not "natural" high achievers. 
                    A growth mindset, as conceived by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck and colleagues, is the belief that a person's capacities and talents can be improved over time.

                <article><h2>What is Happiness?</h2> 
                    <p>Happiness is an electrifying and elusive state. 
                    Philosophers, theologians, psychologists, and even economists have long sought to define it. 
                    And since the 1990s, a whole branch of psychology—positive psychology—has been dedicated to pinning it down. 
                    More than simply positive mood, happiness is a state of well-being that encompasses living a good life, one with a sense of meaning and deep contentment.
                    Feeling joyful has its health perks as well.
